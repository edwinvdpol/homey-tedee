# Tedee Smart Lock

Unlock your door with Homey.

To integrate your Tedee Smart Lock with Homey, you will need Tedee Bridge which must be connected to the internet.

This app allows you to unlock or lock your lock, get device details like battery status and update certain device settings. You also will be able to create flows based on lock state and more.

This app was created thanks to the great work of Edwin van de Pol (@edwinvdpol). Thank you.
