# Tedee for Homey

Unlock your keyless life.

Say goodbye to traditional keys and welcome new ways to access, protect, and share your home. Open your door with just a smartphone, smartwatch, or PIN.

It's time to redefine your front door's purpose. Install a Tedee GO or Tedee PRO smart lock on the interior side of your door lock, making it invisible from the outside.

Connect it to a Wi-Fi-enabled Tedee Bridge for seamless integration with Homey. Welcome to a new era of convenience, security, and smart automation, synchronized with your comings and goings as though your home had an on/off switch.
